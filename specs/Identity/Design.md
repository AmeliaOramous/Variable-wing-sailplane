Confirmed. Direction 01 — Hinge Line is locked.

I’ll define it precisely. This is the master version. No alternatives, no decoration.

⸻

Logo: Hinge Line

Core geometry
	•	Wing bar: horizontal rectangle
	•	Aspect ratio: 8:1
	•	Height defines the system unit (x)
	•	Hinge line: single diagonal line
	•	Angle: 22.5°
	•	Stroke weight: 0.75× wing height
	•	Intersects wing bar left of center (≈38%)

Nothing is centered. This avoids logo-generic symmetry.

Visual logic
	•	Horizontal = lift surface
	•	Diagonal = controlled variability
	•	Intersection = mechanism, not metaphor

If someone asks what it “means,” the answer is: the pivot.

Wordmark

Name: Variable Wing Sailplane
(no hyphens, no abbreviations)

Typeface
	•	Primary: Inter Medium
(IBM Plex Sans Medium is also acceptable; pick one and commit)

Settings
	•	Tracking: −1% to −2%
	•	Optical size: text must feel slightly denser than UI defaults
	•	Case: Title Case only

No custom letterforms. No extended glyphs. Let restraint do the work.

⸻

Lockups

Primary (default)

[ MARK ]  Variable Wing Sailplane

	•	Mark on the left
	•	Text baseline aligned to the hinge intersection, not the bar center
	•	Spacing between mark and text: 2× wing height

Secondary (stacked)

[ MARK ]
Variable Wing
Sailplane

Only for square or narrow formats.

⸻

Clear space
	•	Minimum clear space on all sides: height of wing bar
	•	Nothing enters this zone. Ever.

Minimum size
	•	Digital: 24 px height
	•	Print: 6 mm height
If it fails below this, don’t use it.

⸻

Color rules
	1.	Primary: black on white
	2.	Inverse: white on black
	3.	Accent (optional):
	•	Aero cyan or
	•	Signal amber
Accent is allowed only on the hinge line, never the wing bar or text.

If someone suggests gradients: no.

What I will produce next

Next response, I will deliver:
	•	Primary logo SVG
	•	Horizontal + stacked SVG lockups
	•	Monochrome + inverse versions
	•	One-page usage sheet (spacing, size, do/don’t)

Before I generate files, confirm one thing:

Typeface choice:
Reply with “Inter” or “IBM Plex Sans.”

Nothing else is needed.
