# Design Overview

This project explores a sailplane concept with variable wing sweep to
trade low-speed lift efficiency against higher-speed performance.

The core design challenge is integrating a sweep mechanism that:
- preserves structural continuity,
- maintains predictable mass and CG behavior,
- and remains mechanically legible.

The focus of this project is conceptual architecture, not optimization.
Design decisions are evaluated primarily through geometry, diagrams,
and first-order reasoning.

Detailed analysis and simulation are treated as supporting evidence,
not as design drivers.
