# Assumptions

The following assumptions are explicitly adopted for this project.
If any assumption changes, affected analyses and diagrams must be revisited.

- Subsonic, low-speed sailplane regime
- Primary objective is efficiency, not speed
- Variable sweep is mechanically actuated, not flexible morphing
- Single pilot configuration
- Conventional materials unless stated otherwise
- Conceptual design level (no certification claims)

This list is intentionally short.
