# Structural Load Paths (Conceptual)

Goal:
Document how lift loads travel through the variable-sweep mechanism.

## Primary Loads
- Wing bending (vertical)
- Wing torsion (pitching moment)
- Shear at pivot
- Actuator load (if actuator reacts torque)

## Conceptual Load Path
Lift -> wing spar -> root structure -> bearing/pivot -> fuselage hardpoint

Key question:
Where does torsion go, and what prevents wing root twist under load?

## Mechanism-Specific Risks
- Bearing sees combined bending + torsion reaction
- Root structure must maintain alignment across sweep range
- Actuator may become a structural member unintentionally

## What To Add Next
- Free-body diagram at root for min and max sweep
- Note the “worst case” configuration (often high speed + gust)
